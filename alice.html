        <h3>Alice (Jan Švankmajer, 1988)</h3>
        <div class="format">Blu-ray</div>
        <div class="notes">
          Švankmajer’s first feature-length film, blending live-action and stop-motion animation in a surreal, dreamlike
          retelling of Carroll’s story. Titled "Něco z Alenky" ("Something from Alice") in Czech, it stars Kristýna
          Kohoutová as Alice and features animated taxidermy, toys, and household objects. Švankmajer rejected
          fairy-tale interpretations, instead presenting the narrative as an amoral dream driven by unconscious
          impulses.
